        <p><strong><u>Wealth Preservation Services</u></strong></p>

        <p><span class="bigletter">A</span>lpert Law Firm works with entrepreneurs, high net worth individuals and family businesses to develop and implement long-term strategic objectives directed towards the inter-generational transfer of wealth.</p>

        <p>Our team provides tax and corporate advice to develop plans that reduce and defer tax, preserve value and maintain the financial well-being of heirs. Wealth preservation often involves the creation of holding companies, a corporate reorganisation, and the implementation of an estate freeze.</p>

        <p>Howard Alpert, C.S. is certified by the Law Society as a Certified Specialist (Estates and Trusts Law) and a Certified Specialist (Corporate & Commercial Law). Howard provides tax and estate planning solutions to preserve the value of estates by leaving as much as possible to your heirs, in a timely and cost-effective manner. Such planning regularly requires the preparation of wills, trusts, powers of attorney, living wills and property transfers.</p>

        <p>Family business disagreements are extremely stressful and can damage relationships. It is also necessary to provide for contingency plans in relationships with business partners. We will work with you and your accountants and other professional advisors to plan and implement a current shareholder agreement to provide for orderly ownership and management continuity.</p>
